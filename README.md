# Retro Pong

Relive the golden age of gaming with this **classic Pong clone** built in Python using the `turtle` graphics module.  
Two players, one ball, endless rivalry.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The ball bounces around the screen.
- Each player controls a paddle to keep the ball in play.
- If a player misses, the opponent scores a point.
- First to infinity wins (or until you decide to quit 😉).

---

## Controls

**Right Paddle (Player 1)**  
- ⬆️ Arrow Up → Move Up  
- ⬇️ Arrow Down → Move Down  

**Left Paddle (Player 2)**  
- `W` → Move Up  
- `S` → Move Down  

---

## Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- No external libraries required (uses only the standard `turtle` module)

---

## Installation & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VasilisKokotakis/Pong-Game.git
